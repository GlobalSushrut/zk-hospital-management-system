# ZK-Proof-Based Decentralized Healthcare Infrastructure

A production-grade, secure, and privacy-preserving healthcare data management system using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Merkle Trees, and distributed architecture.

## Overview

This infrastructure provides a comprehensive solution for managing healthcare data with a focus on security, privacy, and compliance. It enables secure sharing of medical information between doctors, patients, labs, and insurers while maintaining cryptographic verification of all data and actions.

Key features:
- ZK-Proof identity and permissions management
- Tamper-proof document storage with Merkle Tree verification
- Comprehensive event logging for full traceability
- AI-powered treatment path recommendations with explainable history
- RESTful API for seamless integration with existing systems

## Architecture

The system consists of four primary components:

1. **ZK-Mongo Container**: Manages identity proofs and claims verification
2. **Cassandra Archive**: Provides tamper-proof document storage with cryptographic verification
3. **Event Logger**: Tracks all system actions with retry capabilities
4. **YAG Updater**: Learns and recommends treatment paths based on verified outcomes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.13+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB
- Apache Cassandra

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/telemedicine/zkhealth.git
   cd zkhealth
   ```

2. Start the database containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Build and run the application:
   ```
   go build -o zkhealth ./cmd/server
   ./zkhealth
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Identity Management

- `POST /identity/register` - Register a new identity with a claim
- `POST /identity/validate` - Validate an identity claim

### Document Management

- `POST /document/store` - Store a document with cryptographic verification
- `GET /document/by-owner/{owner}` - Retrieve all documents for an owner
- `POST /document/verify` - Verify a document's authenticity

### Event Logging

- `POST /event/log` - Log a new event
- `GET /event/{id}` - Get an event by ID
- `POST /event/{id}/resolve` - Resolve an event
- `GET /event/by-party/{party}` - Get all events for a party

### Treatment Paths

- `POST /treatment/path` - Update a treatment path
- `GET /treatment/path/{symptom}` - Get all treatment paths for a symptom
- `GET /treatment/recommend/{symptom}` - Get the recommended treatment for a symptom
- `GET /treatment/symptoms` - Get all symptoms

## Security Features

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Identity verification without revealing sensitive information
2. **Merkle Tree Hashing**: Cryptographic verification of document integrity
3. **Append-Only Storage**: Tamper-proof document archiving in Cassandra
4. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Full tracking of all system actions

## Compliance

This infrastructure is designed with compliance in mind:

- HIPAA compliant through comprehensive audit trails and secure data handling
- GDPR compliant with explicit consent tracking and data access controls
- Supports full regulatory auditing through event logs and cryptographic verification

## Production Deployment

For production environments:

1. Configure proper authentication for MongoDB and Cassandra
2. Implement TLS for all API endpoints
3. Set up proper backup and replication for databases
4. Configure monitoring and alerting
5. Implement proper log rotation and archiving
