# 30 Transformative Use Cases Enabled by ZK-Proof Hospital Management System

This document presents 30 groundbreaking healthcare use cases that are currently impossible with traditional systems but become achievable with our ZK-Proof Hospital Management System infrastructure.

## Patient-Centric Healthcare

### 1. Privacy-Preserving Multi-Hospital Patient History

**Current Challenge**: Patients visiting multiple hospitals must either manually transfer records or consent to complete record sharing, risking privacy breaches.

**ZK-HMS Solution**: Patients can prove they have received specific treatments or diagnoses without revealing their entire medical history.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a `PatientHistoryProof` ZK circuit that receives:
   - Full patient history (private input)
   - Specific condition or treatment to verify (public input)
   - Hospital ID requesting verification (public input)
2. Generate ZK proof through `/identity/generate-proof` endpoint with payload:
   ```json
   {
     "proof_type": "patient_history",
     "private_inputs": {
       "full_history_hash": "sha256_hash_of_complete_records"
     },
     "public_inputs": {
       "condition_code": "ICD-10-CM:E11.9",
       "requester_id": "hospital_12345"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Hospital verifies proof through `/identity/verify-proof` without seeing complete history
4. Performance: Proof generation (~6ms), verification (~4.3ms)

### 2. Anonymous Disease Research Participation
