## Engineering Requirements Going Forward

While our system has demonstrated exceptional performance in benchmarks, it now needs infrastructure-level upgrades to be production-ready at scale. The current implementation provides a solid foundation, but requires these critical enhancements to handle real-world healthcare deployment:

| Infrastructure Need | Reason |
|---------------------|--------|
| üîÅ **ZK Circuit Toolkit** | So new healthcare proofs can be developed rapidly |
| üìà **Horizontal Scaling** | To handle national-level hospital loads (10K+ ops/sec) |
| üîê **Advanced Security** | For real-world threats (side-channel attacks, key mgmt) |
| üìä **Monitoring & Resilience** | For uptime, real-time diagnosis, zero-downtime |
| üîó **Interoperability** | To work with FHIR, HL7, DICOM, EHRs |

### 1. ZK-Circuit Development Framework üîÅ

**Current Status**: Basic ZK proof generation and verification exists, but lacks a standardized development framework for new use cases.

**Requirements**:
- Create unified ZK circuit development toolkit with standard libraries
- Build automated testing framework for ZK circuits
- Implement circuit optimization tools for performance tuning
- Develop domain-specific language for healthcare ZK applications

### 2. Horizontal Scaling Architecture üìà

**Current Status**: System performs well on single instances but lacks horizontal scaling capabilities.

**Requirements**:
- Implement stateless API layer with load balancing
- Create distributed cache synchronization protocol
- Develop sharding strategy for Cassandra database
- Build auto-scaling infrastructure with Kubernetes
- Achieve 10,000+ operations per second throughput

### 3. Enhanced Security Framework üîê

**Current Status**: Basic security is implemented but lacks comprehensive protection layers.

**Requirements**:
- Implement formal verification of ZK circuit security properties
- Add side-channel attack protections
- Create comprehensive key management system
- Develop advanced threat modeling and penetration testing
- Implement secure key rotation and revocation protocols

### 4. Production Monitoring and Reliability üìä

**Current Status**: Basic benchmarking exists but lacks production-grade monitoring.

**Requirements**:
- Develop real-time performance monitoring dashboard
- Implement automated anomaly detection
- Create circuit breaker patterns for graceful degradation
- Build comprehensive alerting and on-call system
- Deploy zero-downtime update mechanisms

### 5. Interoperability Expansion üîó

**Current Status**: Core functionality works well but lacks comprehensive interoperability.

**Requirements**:
- Develop FHIR API compatibility layer (R4 standard)
- Implement DICOM integration for medical imaging
- Create HL7 v2/v3 message processing
- Build interoperability test suite with major EHR systems (Epic, Cerner, Allscripts)
- Support international healthcare data standards
