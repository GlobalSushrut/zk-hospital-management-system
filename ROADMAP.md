# 🧱 ZK-Proof-Based Decentralized Healthcare Infrastructure Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the complete build plan for our decentralized, cross-border telemedicine infrastructure, broken down by modules, priorities, and implementation phases.

## 📌 Current Status

The following core components have been implemented:

- ✅ **ZK-Mongo Identity Registry**: Trustless multi-party claims & consent ledger
- ✅ **Cassandra + Merkle Archive**: Immutable, secure medical document chain
- ✅ **Event Logger**: Retry-safe action state manager
- ✅ **YAG AI Engine**: Adaptive treatment predictor
- ✅ **Consent Management**: Multi-party consent framework
- ✅ **Treatment Vector Misalignment**: Treatment path deviation detection

## 🔍 Build Plan by Priority

### 1️⃣ Phase 1: Core Security & Compliance (Weeks 1-3)

- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Develop API security middleware

#### 📊 Consent Viewer Terminal
- Build consent timeline visualizer
- Implement revocation mechanism
- Develop proof trail export functionality

### 2️⃣ Phase 2: Deployment & Monitoring (Weeks 4-6)

#### 📦 Docker & Orchestration with Health Monitoring
- Finalize all container definitions
- Configure Kubernetes orchestration
- Implement health checks and monitoring

#### 🏛️ Admin & Auditor Dashboard
- Develop actor log view
- Build regulatory compliance view
- Implement real-time alerts system

#### 📈 YAG Vector & Treatment Deviation Tracker
- Enhance treatment path graph visualization
- Improve misalignment resolver
- Expand treatment feedback logger

### 3️⃣ Phase 3: Advanced Features & Global Compliance (Weeks 7-10)

#### 🧠 YAG AI Versioning & Auditable Memory
- Implement memory snapshot engine
- Develop rollback support
- Build explainability module

#### 📲 Secure Device Identity & MFA
- Create device registry
- Implement challenge protocol
- Develop MFA options

#### 🌍 Geographic Resolver & Agreement Mapper
- Build geo resolver API
- Implement dynamic oracle mapping
- Develop zone-based feature toggler

#### 📂 DICOM/PDF Secure Uploader & Hasher
- Create file splitter with Merkle hashing
- Implement viewer and preview engine
- Develop ZK file submission proof
